###**Research Question**: 
What is the effect of the KYTC scholarship on students after they gradute from school and begin working?




### KYTC Scholarship Background
The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Civil Engineering Scholarship Program began in 1948. There are roughly 80 scholarship students in the program at any given time. Students who are attending or planning to attend the University of Kentucky (UK), Western Kentucky University (WKU), or University of Louisville J. B. Speed School of Engineering (UofL) to obtain a Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) are eligible to apply. Students may also attend pre-engineering courses at Kentucky State University (KSU), Kentucky Community and Technical College System, or other Kentucky state colleges or universities, and then finish their Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering at UK, WKU, or UofL. [1](https://transportation.ky.gov/Education/Pages/Civil-Engineering-Scholarship.aspx) 

There are many **benefits** to the KYTC scholarship including: 
- Stipends that cover all of your tuition 
- Guarenteed summer internships during your college career
- A guartenteed job out of college

The debatable cost of reciving the aforementioned benefits is that for each year a student recieves a stipend they are required to work a year at KYTC. There is an option to pay back the stipends, but the compounded interest on the loan is quite hefty. Lets put it this way, I would have to pay roughly $100,000 back. Another cost to students is that their are other jobs that offer higher paying jobs than KYTC, thus there is an economic loss during the required years of service. Money is worth more in the present than in the future. (find a cool link) So the question becomes how much do I have to assume time is worth for the cost (lost wages) post-graduation is worth less than the benefit (stipends) pre-graduation. 


### Assumptions

This blog only captures the benefit of recieving stipends. The summer internships are not required, so I am assuming students are not taking them. Also, the benefit of having a gaurenteed job is a tough one to quantify, instead I am assuming that a student has another job already lined up for when they graduate. In other words, the summer internships and gaurenteed job are icing on the cake. I am assuming that there are not any differences in benefits, working hours, taxes are neglible, essentially that the only difference between the jobs is their [wages](http://www.differencebetween.net/business/finance-business-2/difference-between-wage-and-income/) Many of my assumptions are aligned to put the scholarship behind the 8-ball, to simulate a worst case scenario and test the effect.


The analysis is broken down into two assumed scenarios:

1. A student receives the scholarship their freshmen year, graduates with their bachelors degree in 4 years, recieves their EIT II raise after two years of working, and finnaly finishes out their last two years of service required by the scholarship.  

2. A student recieves the scholarship their freshmen year, graduates with their masters degree in 5 years, recieves their EIT II raise after two years of working, recieves their TE I raise after two more years, and finnaly works off their last remaining year of service at KYTC.  

These scenarios are rather fast-paced and may not represent a typical civil engineering student. The scenarios were chosen to play devils advocate. I won't get to into detail yet, but know that if a student finishes thier degree in a shorter amount of time, then the cost (loss wages) is discounted less. The assumption of a student passing the required exams ([FE and PE](https://kyboels.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx)) and recieving promotions as soon as they are eligible are also made. 

A major assumption of this analysis is what the wages of the alternate job is. [PUMS data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html) is used to find the average wages of a civil engineer with a bachelors degree that is working in Kentucky. So, I am assuming a student would stay within Kentucky. After processing the data to account for some suprise anomalies, the average wages is assumed to be $56,225. The only difference in the masters scenario is that I add a filter of having a masters. The average wages for the alternate job in the masters scenarios is assumed to be $62,369.


### Data

Two data sources are used for this blog. The first is my own information gained from being in the scholarship program, and the other is the PUMS data provided by the US census. My word is pretty much all I can provide to validate the former, but most of the information on wages and the scholarship is available online. The PUMS data can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html), and the WAGP field is used. I had to filter the data, so that I was only averging the wages of a civil engineer with a bachelors degree. There are many "occupation" fields within the PUMS dataset. However, the FOD1P field provided the most records and the most reasonable average wages. The civil engineering FOD1P code is 2406. The SCHL field is used to filter out the engineers that have a bachelors degree. The SCHL code for a bachelors degree is 21. Filtering by education prevents any overstimation by including the wages of engineers with graudate degrees. A similar process is completed for the masters scenario, with the only exception being the SCHL code 22 is used to filter out engineers with a masters degree. I had to clip both sets of wages by $1 and $100,000 to avoid anomalies in the data as well. See bonus material at the end for a good laugh.


## Method
The benefits and costs had to be converted to a present day value, so that apples can be compared to apples. I chose the first year (freshmen year) as my present day. Benefits and costs after the base year have to be discounted before they can be compared. This means that the analysis is very sensitive to the rate that benefits and costs are discounted at. A range of [effective interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectiveinterest.asp) are tested to see what rate needs to be assumed for a student to be better off having the scholarship. On one end is 0%, which assigns no value to time (not smart), and on the other is a 10% effective interest rate (a damn good investor). Equation 1 is used to discount the benefits and costs to a base year value. 

**Equation 1** P = F(1+i)^n

P = Present/Base year value

F = Future year value

i = effective interest rate

n = number of years the future year is from the base year



##**Finnaly the fun part of the blog!!!**


## Results
Now that we have all of the nasty background out of the way we can finnaly dig into what we all want to see. Table 1 shows, for each year, all of the benefits and costs and present values for each of the interest rates.
