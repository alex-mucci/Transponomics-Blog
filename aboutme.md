### Short Bio
My name is Alex Mucci. I have a bachelors degree in civil engineering and a masters degree in transportation engineering from the [**University of Kentucky**](https://www.uky.edu). I am currently pursuing a doctorate while working at the [**Kentucky Transportation Cabinent**](https://transportation.ky.gov/Pages/Home.aspx) as an engineer in training. I love my job and research, but there are still things outside of their realm that interest me. That is where the [**Transponomics Blog**](https://alex-mucci.github.io/blog) comes in and fills the gaps. I take a data scientist approach when I make the blogs, so I apologize in advance for any dry writting :). I am an avid listener of the [**Talking Headways**](http://streetsblog.libsyn.com/) and [**Freakonomics**](http://freakonomics.com/) podcasts, and credit them for inspiring me to create the Transponomics blog. My goal is to provide answers to transportation and economic questions people care about, but simply don't have time to answer themselves. Feel free to [**email**](mailto:Alex.Mucci@uky.edu) me with any question you want to see answered.
