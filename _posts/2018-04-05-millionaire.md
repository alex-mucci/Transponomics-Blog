Most everyone wants to be a millionare, or at least be able to live comfortably and not stress over money. About a month ago I fell under the category of wanting finicial freedom, but did not know of any strategies to achieve it. I have researched the topic and have a few things to share.

1) Make a spreadsheet or somehow visualize your spending. It will put things into perspective. 
2) Set goals... realistic goals
3) Listen to podcasts or read about the topic. Listening to success stories and strategies can help keep you excited about saving money.
4) Start early with your retirement.
5) Do not give up! Dont let a small slip up, or unexpected expense get you down.


There are numerous ways to visualize your spending, but here < 



Still a work in progress... Thank you for your patience.



Here's a sample table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |
