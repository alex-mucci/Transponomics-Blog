### Short Bio
My name is Alex Mucci. I have a bachelores and masters degree at the [**University of Kentucky**](https://www.uky.edu). I am currently pursuing a doctorate while working at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinent as an engineer in training. I love my job and research, but there are still things outside of their realm that interests me. That is where the [**Transponomics Blog**](https://alex-mucci.github.io/blog) comes in and fills the gaps. I take a data scientist approach when I am writting my blogs, so I apologize in advance for any dry writting :grin:. My goal is to answer transportation and economic questions people care about, but dont have the time to figure out. Feel free to [**email**](mailto:Alex.Mucci@uky.edu) me with any question you would like to see answered.
