### Short Bio
My name is Alex Mucci. I have a bachelores degreen in civil engineering and a masters degree in transportation engineering from the [**University of Kentucky**](https://www.uky.edu). I am currently pursuing a doctorate while working at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinent as an engineer in training. I love my job and research, but there are still things outside of their realm that interest me. That is where the [**Transponomics Blog**](https://alex-mucci.github.io/blog) comes in and fills the gaps. I take a data scientist approach when I make the blogs, so I apologize in advance for any dry writting :). My goal is to provide answers to transportation and economic questions people care about, but simply don't have time to answer themselves. Feel free to [**email**](mailto:Alex.Mucci@uky.edu) me with any question you want to see answered.
